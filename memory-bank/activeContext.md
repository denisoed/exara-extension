# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Browser action click event debugging and improvement
- Extension manifest V3 compliance verification
- Background service worker event registration optimization
- Extension permissions verification
- Chrome API integration testing
- Explanation style improvements and user feedback
- Refining style persistence implementation

## Recent Changes
- Updated browser action configuration in manifest
- Implemented direct chrome.action API usage for Manifest V3 compliance
- Added tab creation and message passing on browser action click
- Configured extension permissions (storage, sidePanel, scripting, action)
- Enhanced error handling for message passing
- Replaced "expert" explanation style with "beginner" style
- Added "analogy" style with real-life metaphors for technical concepts
- Updated translations for all explanation styles in language files
- Modified popup component to handle style selection via dropdown
- Implemented persistent storage for selected explanation style using StorageKey
- Added style preservation across user sessions and clarification questions

## Next Steps
1. Complete browser action click event debugging
2. Add comprehensive logging for extension behavior
3. Test extension permissions in different browsing contexts
4. Improve error handling for API failures
5. Enhance user experience with smoother transitions
6. Gather user feedback on explanation styles effectiveness
7. Optimize performance for style switching
8. Ensure consistent translations across all languages
9. Document browser action implementation patterns

## Active Decisions
- Using WXT as the extension framework for development
- TypeScript for strict type safety throughout codebase
- React for UI components with functional patterns
- Bun as package manager for faster dependency handling
- shadcn/ui for component library with Tailwind integration
- Tailwind for styling with custom theme support
- Biome for linting and formatting consistency
- Direct chrome.action API usage for browser action
- Manifest V3 compliance for future compatibility
- TypeScript enums for explanation styles
- Three-tier explanation system (child, student, beginner) plus analogy style
- Persistent explanation style selection with localStorage
- Style preservation across user sessions

## Considerations
- Manifest V3 service worker limitations
- Extension permissions scope optimization
- Background service worker lifecycle management
- Cross-browser compatibility challenges
- Error handling strategies for API failures
- Performance optimization for content script injection
- User experience improvements
- Explanation style effectiveness for different user demographics
- Translation accuracy and cultural considerations
- Security best practices for extension development
- Performance impact of style switching
- Memory usage optimization
