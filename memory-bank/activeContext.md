# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Browser action click event debugging
- Extension manifest V3 compliance
- Background service worker event registration
- Extension permissions verification
- Chrome API integration testing
- Explanation style improvements

## Recent Changes
- Updated browser action configuration in manifest
- Implemented direct chrome.action API usage
- Added tab creation on browser action click
- Configured extension permissions
- Added basic error handling
- Replaced "expert" explanation style with "beginner" style
- Added real-life analogies for technical concepts
- Updated translations in both language files
- Modified popup component to reflect new explanation styles

## Next Steps
1. Debug browser action click event registration
2. Verify manifest V3 configuration
3. Test extension permissions in different contexts
4. Implement comprehensive error handling
5. Add detailed logging for debugging
6. Document browser action implementation patterns
7. Test and refine explanation styles
8. Gather user feedback on explanation clarity
